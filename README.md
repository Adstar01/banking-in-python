# Banking Management System using Python and SQL
Designed and implemented a secure Banking Management System that effectively manages user and admin functionalities. This project utilized Python and an SQL database to store and manipulate data securely. Key features include user registration, login authentication with hashed passwords, and role-based access control for customers and admins. Customers can view their account balance, deposit and withdraw funds, transfer money between accounts, and view their transaction history. Admins can perform the same operations on behalf of any customer, as well as view individual transaction histories and reset customer passwords. Robust exception handling was incorporated to manage invalid inputs and database errors, enhancing the overall reliability of the system.

This project demonstrated skills in database management, secure password handling, user interface design, and software development principles. It provided practical experience in using Bloom's taxonomy verbs such as creating, analyzing, and evaluating the design and security aspects of the application, thus ensuring data integrity and user authentication.
